# Arduino Module-Based Project Ideas ðŸ’¡

This repository contains code and circuit diagrams for **Line Follower** and **Maze Runner** robots â€” classic entry-level projects in robotics. These bots are designed to follow a visible path on the ground, typically using contrast between black/blue lines and a white surface (or vice versa).

Whether you're just starting out or refining your robotics skills, this project may help guide your learning. The code and wiring are beginner-friendly and ready to use!
